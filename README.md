WumpusWorld
===========

An implementation in Java of the famous puzzle game Wumpus.

This project was developed for the purposes of the course 'Artificial Intelligence' of cs department, Athens University of Economics and Business(AUEB), during the Winter semester 2012 - 2013.

This is not a game that you can actually play. Instead you the agent moves on it's own around the map trying to find the gold, by making inferences using first order logic and the Forward Chaining algorithm.

Create you own world by editing the file res/world.xml

Then run the main class src/wumpus/journey/Journey.java and see every step of the agent while he walks around the board.


#### Note : If the board is carefully created and the agent does not have to make random moves due to uncertainty, he will definitely find the gold!
